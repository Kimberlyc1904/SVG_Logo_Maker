## Weather_Dashboard_Homework6

- My motivation in building a SVG Logo Maker is to get better at JavaScripting.
- I built this SVG Logo Maker to allow someone to quickly create a logo using different shapes, text and colors.
- I learned a little JavaScripting.

## User Story
```
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects
SO THAT I don't have to pay a graphic designer
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
WHEN I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser
THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
```

## Usage

To use the Weather Dashboard, type type in a city to the search and click the "get city" button. You will be presented with current weather and the next 5 days of weather forcast.
